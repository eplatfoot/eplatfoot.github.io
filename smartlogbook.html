      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>The app used Holo, the previous design language. It needed to be updated using the current Android Visual Design requirements.
        There were also usability issues that needed to be addressed.</p>

    <div class="intro-section content">
      <h3>My Contribution</h3>
      <p>I created mock designs using Adobe XD. I applied the current requirements using the Android Material Design website.</p>

        <p>The <strong>Flight screen</strong> is where the pilot records information about each flight.</p>
        <p>The Google Calendar App provided inspiration for the appearance of this screen.
          The app has clickable text and is divided into sections with lines. There are left
          aligned icons for the user to be able to quickly identify each section.</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            I grouped the information into sections, aligning the icons on the far left,
            followed by the clickable text buttons, and the information the user inputs is
            right-aligned. I used lines to divide the content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each section has an icon to represent the type of information being displayed.
            This will grab the attention of the pilot so they can quickly scan the screen. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The gray, clickable text is a button that is left aligned and allows the user to either input content with a dialog, brings them to a secondary screen to make a selection, or allows them to . After the information is entered or selected, it appears on the right side of the screen in black. In the previous version, the information was mostly left justified but it had multiple actions in each row.  The buttons, icons, and actions made it difficult to quickly scan and process the screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Duration screen includes a bright blue Add button. This allows the pilot to add additional fields to this section.  Even though the previous version had an + Add duration  button it blended in with the rest of the screen and pilots occasionally couldn’t find the button or didn’t realize it was clickable.

        <p>The <strong>Aircraft screen</strong> tracks the planes the pilots fly.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            I modified the App bar replacing outdated icons with commonly used action and navigation icons. 
          </li>
          <li>
            I included an option for pilots to have the ability to add photos of their airplane to their
            aircraft list.  Having an image there will make it easier to quickly identify the aircraft in the
            list.  It also looks more visually appealing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Material Design website has very specific style guidelines for the lists.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The image size is 100x56 dp.
              </li>
              <li>
                The spacing also adheres to the specifications identified in the website. 
              </li>
              <li>
                I used the recommended font and size.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The most common action on this screen is to add a new aircraft. I removed the add icon from the top
            of the menu and made it a floating action button (FAB).  Now, the icon is more visible and easier for
            the user to reach.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added the screen’s title (“Aircraft”) to the App bar to be consistent with the flow of other windows.
          </li>
          <li>
            I replaced the back button with the Android Visual Design back button. It is bigger and has a larger
            surface area for tapping. The previous version’s button was too small and the placement was too close
            to the edge of the screen. This made it difficult for the user to accurately tap.

            The user has the ability to sort their flights by registration (alphabetical) or date last flown.
            The Sort button is available in the Overflow menu.  Displaying this information was challenging because
            there are only two options.  I first considered using a menu with radio buttons so the user would know
            which option was already selected.  However, this method was no longer supported in Material Design.
            I made a mockup of a drop down menu, disabling the ability to select the option that was already selected
            and I grayed it out.  That menu didn’t flow well, and I believe it would be confusing to the users. I
            decided instead to create a bottom sheet. This option made it possible to indicate which selection was
            enabled by showing a checkmark next to the text.
